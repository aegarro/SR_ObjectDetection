# SR_ObjectDetection

Senior Research: Object Detection 
Student: Alexandra Garro


This repository holds a Google Colab notebook that will go through the steps of creating an object detector.

We will use a pre-trained mask-rcnn model and apply transfer learning on an apple dataset. The apple dataset that will be used to train the model are images taken manually from Google Images. The label for each image was also individually and manually done. 

The goal of this project is to build an object detector that will be able to identify apples in images. The resulting image will display a bounding box around the object detect (in this case, an apple). In addition to detecting apples, a counting feature is also implemented: allowing the model to count and display the results on the resulting image.
